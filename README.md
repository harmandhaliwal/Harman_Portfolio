# [Ball Image Classifier](https://github.com/harmandhaliwal/Ball-Image-Classifier)
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities.

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.

# [Movie Similarity]( https://github.com/harmandhaliwal/MovieSimilarity) 
In this Project, I used NLP to find the degree of similarity between movies based on their plots available on IMDb and Wikipedia, then seperated them into groups, also known as clusters. Next, I created a dendrogram to represent how closely the movies are related to each other. The dataset I used contains the titles of the top 100 movies on [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) as well as each movie's plot summary from both IMDb and Wikipedia.
